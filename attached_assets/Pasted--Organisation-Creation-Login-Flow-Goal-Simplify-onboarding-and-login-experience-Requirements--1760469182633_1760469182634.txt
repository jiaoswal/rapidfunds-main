. Organisation Creation & Login Flow

Goal: Simplify onboarding and login experience.
Requirements:

When a new user creates or joins an organisation, they should automatically be logged in after the action — no separate login step.

The login system should only trigger when the user returns after closing the app/session.

Store session securely using JWT or similar method.

Ensure smooth redirection:

On signup → Create/Join org → Auto-login → Redirect to dashboard.

On next visit → Detect existing session → Direct to dashboard if valid, else to login page.

2. Organisation Chart (Org Chart) Management

Goal: Make the org chart interactive and manageable.
Requirements:

The org chart toggle and dropdowns should function smoothly (expand/collapse, drag & drop if applicable).

Admin users must have full access to:

Add, edit, or remove members/nodes in the org chart.

Assign roles or hierarchies directly from the org chart interface.

Non-admin users should only have view access.

Ensure real-time updates (via WebSocket or live refresh) when changes are made.

3. Funding Request Criteria (Admin-Controlled)

Goal: Create consistency in funding requests across the organisation.
Requirements:

Admins can set predefined criteria or fields that every funding request must follow — e.g.:

Purpose/Justification

Department/Team

Requested Amount

Expected ROI or Outcome

GST or Tax details

These criteria should be customisable and visible in the funding request form for all users.

Requests that don’t meet criteria should be flagged or rejected automatically.

4. AI-Powered Summary for Admin Inbox

Goal: Have the AI auto-summarise requests clearly for admin review.
Requirements:

The AI should summarise each request in a structured format:

Why the funds are being requested

Who is requesting

What it’s for

How much is being requested

Whether GST is included or applicable

There should be guidelines or templates for AI summarisation to ensure consistency.

Display the AI summary in the admin inbox or dashboard view next to each request.

5. Dashboard — Budget Overview UI

Goal: Improve readability and layout of financial data.
Requirements:

The Budget Overview section should be clearly visualised — not cluttered.

Use cards, charts, and spacing to show:

Total budget

Used budget

Remaining funds

Category-wise allocation

Make it responsive and cleanly structured (avoid text overlap, ensure clarity).

Add tooltips or hover states for details if needed.
